# Life_Typhoon_Pavilion:
This pavilion was the final project for the course of design optioneering at Politecnico di Milano.

# Story:
This pavilion was designed in xx in Hong-kong. It roots back to the Chinese traditions and culture while giving a perspective of the future. The pavilion is composed of two *tubes* skinned by  discrete set of octagonal-shaped wooden units that are extended from each end. The tubes are arranged around a centre point leaving it as the heart and core of the pavilion. The 2 *tubes* llow visitors to enter inside. The tubes are perforated by small circles, which in froup form specific shapes of the oriental culture. 
The *journey* of entering the pavilion can be imagined on several dimensions. These dimensions may vary from one person to another. For instance, the tubes would represnt the suffering of the *hong-kongers* that spend a large portion of their daily comute through tubes, even when it comes to pedestrians. 
Meanwhile, crawling inside the tube may indicate the nostalgia of the child in each adult, a message to the soul to release stress. Following the path leads to an increase in slope (in the top middle) then going back down. The final *lit* exit in the end represents the final *hope* in a better future for everyone suffering in this world
